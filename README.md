Research : Computer Vision (7/2023 - 1/2024)
Project: Monitoring the biological motion of mosquito larvae and Mekada
fish using computer vision( 4 members)

Description: Develop an AI algorithm to detect and identify fish in ponds
with varying concentrations to assist biological researchers in monitoring
Mekada fish activities.

Technologies: CNN , Deep Learning, Computer Vision , Yolov8.

Responsibilities : I am involved in the project from the ideation phase,
analysis, and processing of data, building CNN algorithms to train AI
models for fish recognition, tracking fish movements, positions, analyzing,
and drawing conclusions.
